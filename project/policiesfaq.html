    <h2>All your questions in one convenient location.
    <br><br>
    Got questions?
    <br>
    Read the FAQ!
    </h2>
    <p>Here at the Centre, we don't tolerate stupid questions and irrational thinking. That is part of our program to reintegrate embarrassed individuals into society, not as embarrassments, but rather intellectuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not ready to question and rethink your decisions, then the Centre may not be for you. Keep in mind that most stays are not permanent and that only the most embarrassing of embarrassing moments qualify for a lifetime stay. And even those who are eligible for that stay usually end up back in society.

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Policies</h2>
    <h3>Below is a general outline of our policies. Upon acceptance, more details will be provided. If you are looking to apply, keep in mind that most expectations are reviewed on your orientation day.</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Acceptance Policy</b>
          <br><br>
          To apply at for residency at the Centre, you must be six years old of age or older. If you do not have the ability to write professionally and properly, please have a parent/guardian/another individual fill out the form for you.
          <br><br>
          If you are caught lying, you will be fined a fee of $100.00 for wasting our time. This is not a matter that is to be taken lightly, as the number of embarrassing videos on YouTube skyrockets every single day. We accept and reject hundreds of applications each week. Keep in mind that most applications are rejected.
          <br><br>
          For each applicant, we conduct a background check by reviewing all known social media profiles, school records/transcripts, their criminal record, and more.
          We do not accept individuals who have been accused of sexual assault/other forms of serious misconduct, murder, identity theft, etc.
          Even if your record is perfectly clean or if you only have a few marks, the decision is ultimately up to us regarding whether or not you are accepted into one of the Centres.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
          <b>Conduct</b>
          <br><br>
          You may not show blatant insolence and disrespect for your peers and the employees. The employees are trying their best to bring you a great experience and a safe environment. Any complaints can be submitted at the front desk or submitted via email or phone.
          <br><br>
          Please refrain from ridiculing any resident. If you are a resident, then that means you have done something equally stupid. Hence, you have no right to call someone an idiot if you too are an idiot. We don't care if you call their actions stupid, but please do not to call the individual stupid.
          <br><br>
          Cursing shall be kept to a minimum. Refrain from cursing when it can be helped. We have a section in each facility for individuals 14 and older. Please try to keep most cursing within that sector, as we also accept children here at the Centre.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
          <b>No Camera Policy</b>
          <br><br>
          In short,<br>
              <img src="NoCam.png">
              <br>
          We do not tolerate the free usage of either regular cameras, digital cameras, or disposable cameras on any device or platform. Usage of cameras will result in arrest and a fine up to $250, depending on the severity of the content.
          <br><br>
          To get camera access, please ask the front desk at your local CPTYTMI. You will have to fill out a form that includes your phone number, email, work phone, address, name, and age. You will receive a stamp on your hand. The stamp used changes every day so as to prevent individuals from saying they are already cleared for entrance.
          <br><br>
          If you would like to get camera access and post your content on the World Wide Web, you must send snail mail to the LA CPTYTMI headquarters and specifically ask for permission. You will be asked to state your purpose for posting the content online. Before posting online, all individuals must submit a copy of the content that they intend to put online for everyone to see. If LA HQ does not agree with your content, you will be given the optino to either remake it or trash it entirely and abdicate your camera access until next time.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
          <b>Free Plans</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          For financially challenged applicants and applicants with super embarrassing videos, the Centre may be able to provide a free plan anywhere from a one-month-long stay up to six years. Even if you are not financially challenged but have a monstrous video to share, we may extend the same offer to you, except that offer can range from two months to a lifetime stay. More details on the lifetime plan can be found in the plans tab.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>
          <b>Bias</b>
          Our video reviewers are not shown the names of applicants- hence, the process is entirely blind. This makes it so that no bias leaks through and to ensure that the process is as fair as possible. Any bias towards a particular individual will result in the termination of that staff member. All individuals applying can rest assured that they will not be denied or accepted due to name alone. For all our reviewers know, they could be accepting Donald Trump or Kim Kardashian West into the Centre.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Skip to the bottom for a quick summary of our policies.</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Where are your 17 locations?</b>
      <br>
      We are currently in the process of collecting more funds to install new locations around the world and in the US. All US locations are in the continental US for the time being.
      <br>

    <p>
      <b>Why are people so stupid? Just stop being stupid already?/??</b>
      <br>
      It's not as easy as it sounds. We're pretty sure that you aren't exactly proud of each and every one of your moments either. Everyone has done something idiotic in their life, the applicants just happened to get caught on camera. But who knows, your time may come.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why didn't I get accepted?</b>
      <br>
      We are looking for individuals who have screwed up big-time and want to improve. If you think that coming to the Centre is an excuse to slack behind in schoolwork/work in general, you're in for a surprise. This is not exactly a vacation hotspot. So it's similar, but not quite there. Most of the time, you will be able to relax and enjoy yourself, but that doesn't mean there isn't a schedule you have to follow or classes to take. The Centre is only a temporary shelter for those who can't go outside without eyes prying into their souls. If you aren't being stared at when you go outside, then you haven't royally screwed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why are there so many policies? Do I have to read them all?</b>
      <br>
      We have many policies instated to make sure that our residents don't regress further. And the policies on this page are not the only ones. 
      <br><br>
      To answer your second question, no, you certainly don't have to read them all. We don't care if you skim over it, as long as you get the gist of what we're trying to say. A couple of the more important rules can be found at the bottom of the FAQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Is there free food?</b>
      <br>
      With your acceptance into the Centre, yes, there is free food provided. We allow our residents to indulge themselves in three meals a day and present a wide variation of courses each meal. However, you are free to bring along money of your own and find a restaurant outside of the Centre to eat at. There will always be snacks in the dining hall if you're looking for a midday or midnight snack.
      <br><br>
      If you aren't a resident, well, let's just say that all Centres come equipped with delicious peppermints and gum.
