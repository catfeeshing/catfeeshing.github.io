<div class="row content">  <div class="column side homeside">    <h2>No cameras anytime, anywhere.</h2>    <p>Here at the Centre, we value <i>your</i> safety and security. You can rest assured that no individual will be taking pictures or videos of you for the duration of your stay.    <p>Should you be found with any cameras, the police will be notified and the situation will henceforth be outside of our control.     <img src="/images/NoCam.png">    </p>    <p>      If you would like to use a camera, alert the front table before doing so. To post a video or image online, you must get permission from the LA headquarters via snail mail and show the front desk the document. The document will be stamped by the front desk and hence will only be good for one use.    </p>    <p>      Read more about our camera-free policy in the <b><a href="policiesfaq.html">Policies and FAQ</a></b> tab.      </p>  </div>      <div class="column middle">    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the CPTYTMI.</h2>      <div style="text-align: center">      <iframe align="center" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVOo6LoosgY" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>    <hr>    <p id="hp1"><b>Have you been embarrassed, big-time, on one of the largest media platforms in the world?    </b></p>    <hr>    <p>      If so, then the Centre for People That YouTube Made Infamous might be just the place for you.    </p>    <p>      We are dedicated to bringing all eligible individuals worldwide a safe environment in which they are free from prying eyes and the press. The Centre is the perfect rehabilitation centre for those who have attracted media attention by doing something embarrassing. In other words, we provide a luxurious sanctuary for those who feel like absolute idiots and have gotten famous for being an idiot.    </p>    <p>      Don't be afraid of expressing your inner idiot. After all, it won't seem too idiotic considering it's a Centre full of those who feel like idiots. While the Centre is a rehabilitation centre to correct rash behaviour, we also dedicate our time to making your stay at the Centre comfortable and fun. We invite lecturers from all over the world to give presentations on stupidity, the humanities, mathematics, and tons of other activities.    </p>    <p>      We have access to free online college courses and school courses from the first grade to twelfth grade. As long as you are cleared to attend a certain college or university, you have access to their online courses (if available). Courses not available online? Check out the library at your local Centre for thousands of books. We have a massive selection of textbooks for you to choose from. All for free, as long as you present your CPTYTMI card.    </p>    <p>      If you feel like an idiot for doing something idiotic, you might just be able to apply for a stay at the Centre! Depending on the amount of views you have and how embarrassing the video is, you will be eligible for one of our four plans.    </p>    <p>      Applications can be found <a href="apply.html">here</a> and plans can be found <a href="plans.html">here</a>.    </p>  </div>  <div class="column side">    <h2>Superstar Residents</h2>    <p>Our former residents include some of today's biggest  (accidental?) stars.</p>    <p>One such example is Kazuhiko Kosaka, the legendary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E00Zuayv9Q">Pen Pineapple Apple Pen</a> man, who, after becoming an Internet sensation, immediately contacted the Centre and was made eligible for a lifetime stay. However, due to lack of attention now, he kindly asked to leave and exited the Centre to a freer, merrier life.</p>    <img align=center src="/images/KazuhikoKosaka.jpg">    <br>    <p style="text-indent:0; font-size:12px; text-align:center">      <i>An artists' rendition of Kazuhiko Kosaka as DJ Piko-Taro, the fictional DJ behind PPAP.</i>    </p>    <p>      Another one of our more famous residents is Brett Ambler from the viral video  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRpdIrq7Rbo">You on Kazoo!</a>. When the Centre first opened in 2009, Ambler was one of the first to apply for a spot. While we thought the video he was featured in was incredibly embarrassing, he had yet to be featured on YouTube. However, in 2014, a clip was published online that featured him as a little child. Hence, his application was reopened and he was made eligible for a temporary two-month-long stay. He accepted our offer and spent his two months under our care. Ambler has since lived a relatively peaceful life.    </p>    <img align=center src="/images/BrettAmbler.jpg">    <br>        <p style="text-indent:0; font-size:12px; text-align:center">      <i>An artists' rendition of Brett Ambler as a child.</i>    </p>  </div></div>
