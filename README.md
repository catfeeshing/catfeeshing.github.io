salutations! you have found my portfolio :0

this website was originally created as a place to store stuff for my exploring computer science class, but I've since repurposed it.

features:

* some photography (my phone has always been my primary camera, but its data has been wiped about 3 times now, hence the lack of variety in my photos--of these non-robotics photos, a lot of them are blurry to their being taken from my Instagram)
* artwork (I haven't done serious digital art in a while but I've constantly been doodling, so the artwork shown is not really an accurate depiction of my current skill level)
* graphic design (honestly, this is less graphic design and more "I can arrange things and make them look pretty")
* documentation of work from my computer science classes (exploring cs, ap csp, ap csa)
* external links to my projects/extracurriculars! <3

thank you for stopping by :)
