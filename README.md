# catfeeshing.github.io

this website was originally created as a place to store stuff for my exploring computer science class, but I've since repurposed it.

features:

* documentation of work from my computer science classes (exploring cs, ap csp, ap csa)
* external links to my projects/extracurriculars!

thank you for stopping by!
