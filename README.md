salutations! you have found my website :0

this website was originally created as a place to store stuff for my exploring computer science class, but I've since repurposed it.

features:

* graphic design (honestly, this is less graphic design and more "I can arrange things and make them look pretty")
* documentation of work from my computer science classes (exploring cs, ap csp, ap csa)
* external links to my projects/extracurriculars! <3

thank you for stopping by :)

template by w3schools and personalised by me (lol)
if only I set up my website with jekyll
