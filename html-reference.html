    <hr>
    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a system you've seen everywhere without even knowing it.
    <br>
    It is used to spruce up almost all your favourite web pages. Through HTML, you can add colour, different fonts, and more to what would normally be a bland and unremarkable page.
    <br>
    HTML can be used alongside CSS and Javascript, both of which are used to customise websites.</p>
