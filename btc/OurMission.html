<h3><font face="Courier New" color="black">Brackwood Train Co. was founded in 1896 by Alaena Jitpapaya.</font>
    <h1>We are dedicated to bringing you the best train experience possible while keeping our prices affordable.</h1>
    <p>Trains aren't what they used to be. Just a century or two ago, they were all the rage. Everyone could get to everywhere on a train and train tracks were being installed like crazy. It was the brink of a new era! No longer would people have to depend on unreliable forms of traveling.
        But now we are ushering in a new era, one that is centered around cars and both economy and environment-friendly ways of transportation. Trains aren't the most efficient now and they emit lots of carbon dioxide.
        Here at Brackwood Train Co., we're trying to change that. </p>
        <p>Our newest train model, the Brackwood Sungazer, is a train that runs solely on solar power. It has all the components of a regular train and can perform just as well, if not better. The train's design was based on that of a bullet train- very sleek, modern, and, most importantly, aerodynamic.</p>
        <p>For a cheaper alternative to the Sungazer, we offer the Brackwood Duo. The Duo is a hybrid train designed to be very aerodynamic, though it's incomparable to the Sungazer.</p>
    <p>Prices for both trains and other rides can be found <a href-"#">here.</a></p>
