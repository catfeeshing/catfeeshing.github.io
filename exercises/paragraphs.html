<h1>The Raven</h1>
<h2>An Excerpt</h2>
<h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
 <p>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—</p>
    <p>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
 <p>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</p>
<p>“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—</p>
            <p>Only this and nothing more.”</p>

    <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</p>
 <p>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
     <p>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
     <p>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</p>
<p>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
            <p>Nameless here for evermore.</p>

     <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain</p>
 <p>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;</p>
     <p>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating</p>
     <p>“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—</p>
<p>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—</p>
            <p>This it is and nothing more.”</p>

    <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,</p>
<p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;</p>
     <p>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,</p>
     <p>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,</p>
 <p>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—</p>
            <p>Darkness there and nothing more.

     <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,</p>
 <p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;</p>
     <p>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,</p>
     <p>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”</p>
<p>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—</p>
            <p>Merely this and nothing more.</p>
